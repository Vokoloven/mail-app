# Hi there!

**_About_**: It's test application.

## Projects

For building project used **[ReactJs + TypeScript](https://create-react-app.dev/)**\
Some basic **Project** commands are:

| Command          | Description                                                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install `   | Will installed dependencies                                           |
| `npm run start`  | Start project in dev mode                                             |
| `npm run build`  | Build for production                                                  |
| `npm run test `  | Launches the test runner                                              |
